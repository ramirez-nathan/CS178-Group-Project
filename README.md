# CS-178a project
A 2D fighting-platformer game that combines gameplay elements from Smash Bros and Street Fighter, developed using C# and Unity.
The game will feature local and co-op multiplayer, allowing players to engage in dynamic battles across platform-based arenas.
The game will also include a stat tracking system to record player performance, wins/losses, and character usage.
In addition, a companion web application will be developed to display player stats, leaderboards, and competitive data, providing players with insights into their gameplay and rankings.
